"This item is a long-sleeve shirt in a light gray color. It features a classic collared neckline and a button-up front. The fabric appears to be a soft, medium-weight material, possibly a cotton blend, giving it a comfortable and slightly textured feel. It includes two front flap pockets with buttons on the chest for added functionality and style. The fit seems relaxed, providing a casual and laid-back look. The hem is slightly rounded, adding a subtle touch of style to the overall design."
